At this point you have several plugins installed:

`kubectl krew list`{{execute}}

At any time, you can update Krew with the following:

`kubectl krew update`{{execute}}

and upgade the currently installed plugins:

`kubectl krew upgrade`{{execute}}

Find the plugins you like and add them to some infrastructure script you have for maintaining your local kubectl tool.
