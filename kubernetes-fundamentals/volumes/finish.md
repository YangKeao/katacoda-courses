This shows you that Kubernetes is a thing of persistent integrity thanks to the levels of indirection with Linux file mounts, PVs, and PVCs. ðŸ˜‰

The steps were organized to go from easy and basic to more complicated. We hope you made it through each step. If not, go back to the squirrely bits and review them again.

## Lessons Learned ##

With these steps you have learned:

- &#x2714; about the file system inside a container.
- &#x2714; about mounting a volume to a ConfigMap.
- &#x2714; about mounting to the Pod file system.
- &#x2714; about mounting to emptyDir with initContainers.
- &#x2714; about mounting to a Node filesystem.
- &#x2714; about mounting to a Persistent Volume.
- &#x2714; about mounting to a file system outside the cluster.
