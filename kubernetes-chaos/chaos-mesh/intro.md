Chaos Mesh is a cloud-native Chaos Engineering platform that orchestrates chaos on Kubernetes environments. At the current stage, it has the following components:

- Chaos Operator: the core component for chaos orchestration. Fully open-sourced.
- Chaos Dashboard: a Web UI for managing, designing, monitoring Chaos Experiments; under development.

Chaos Mesh is a versatile chaos engineering solution that features all-around fault injection methods for complex systems on Kubernetes, covering faults in Pod, network, file system, and even the kernel.

You will learn how to:

- Install Chaos Mesh onto Kubernetes
- Install and label applications to make them eligible targets for chaos
- Design and deliver a chaos experiment
- Observe the chaos engine exercise your experiment against the cluster objects
