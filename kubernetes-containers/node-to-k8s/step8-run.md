Now that the application is running, access it's web interface:

[Mountains App](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-30300-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com)

Keep in mind that in the interface each time you list, create, update, or remove an item in the mountains list there is a corresponding gRPC message transmitting binary mountain data structures between each container.
