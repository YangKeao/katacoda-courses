These next steps provide an ideal place to start writing applications in Go to run on Kubernetes. Each step will take you from raw Go code to packaging it in a container, and then to running your contained application on Kubernetes.

You will learn how:

- Write some basic Go applications
- Write a basic microservice in Go
- Package a Go microservice in a container
- Run a Go microservice on Kubernetes

> [Go](https://golang.org/) is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
